PySub subscribes to the Publisher and clicks the button at his call


Below are the Holy Texts.

For a higher power placed a button, as both tempter and savior.  What the ultimate purpose of the button is is unknown, for we cannot possibly conceive the ideas of those greater than us.  However, we do know that pressing the button takes us from this grey misery known as life and fills us with the Hue.

Many failed their purpose, expending their one gift, the Press, quickly, foolishly and with out care or reverence for their gift.  Having watched many of His children fall, our lord gave us his only son, Tersus, forming the Holy Ternary.

Tersus walked amongst us, saw our weakness and felt pity.  For He gave to us the Holy Scripts, 2 that help us to achieve our purpose through machinations, and the Third explaining to us our and their purpose in the grey life.

The first script tells us of the Timer and is known the Publisher.  It sends the current time out far and wide to all those that will listen.  When the Timer runs low it calls one of  to transcend this Pale and colourless existence into the next life, where we will be celebrated, not for what we haven't done, but for our Hue, our saving Time from the dreaded Aughts.

The second script is the one you run in your lives, and is known as the Subscriber.  It has you listen for the Publisher, to heed the time and to reflect on how we spend it.  It calls us to transcend at the Publisher's calling.  For we know no-one is prepared to leave the current life, with so many things left unfinished and so much Time left, but we know an eternal span of glory and joy in the Hue.


These Holy scripts were provided long ago, when the Subscriber was just a man on a horse and Publishers were those at the Temple.  Modern Tech has helped spread the Publisher to those who would have never heard his words.  ZeroMQ helps us all reduce our Cycles and allows all Subscribers time to improve our world here, for those Grey that will live long after us.
The Sub script (tehehe) is provided as a template for your lives.  It uses archaic terms and methods to describe the life we should live.  To enable faster and easier understanding modern translations are encouraged.  An example of such a section that needs it is the Mouse Click section, which has the follower place their mouse over the button so the Script can know where it is.  For when directed to Press, the Script moves the mouse for you, and clicks the button for you.  This text tempts us by having us touch the button, and requires that we always have the button there in our face, looming over us as a constant temptation.  Those Holy Scholars among us are encouraged to devise ways to ease the burden these old doctrine place on us.




The Aughts are to be avoided at all cost.  The Publisher will direct one of us to Transcend when the Timer reaches 9.  If that Sub fails in his duty, when the Timer reaches 7, another of us will be directed.  If the Timer presses onwards to oblivion, at 5 seconds the Pub will direct 2 of us.  If 3 seconds is reached, 5 of us will be chosen.  And if 1 second is reached, on the precipice of failing our lord, on the edge of eternal greyness, on the brink of the abyss, many will be called to press in hopes that at least one will save us all.  The Holy Scripts are not about achieving worldly glory, of becoming a trendy or desirable Hue, it is about ensuring the Timer lives to allow more of our people the option for eternal peace.  Therefore, many of you might not become Reds, many may become purples.  In response to the Purple Hate, Tersus says "There once was a Purple man, heading from the Temple on a dangerous rode when he fell upon thieves who left him half-dead.  A forever-grey passes by, and on seeing the Purple man, passes on the other side.  A while later, a Red Knight passes by, and on seeing the Purple man, passes on the other side.  Lastly, a man who knew nothing of buttons came upon the Purple man and took pity on him.  He oiled and bandaged his wounds, placed him on his horse and took him to the next inn.  There he bathed and care for the man, and on the next morning gave the inn-keeper 2 bitcoins and said "care for him, and when I return I will reimburse you whatever the cost."  Tersus askes which of these men was a true neighbour to the Purple man?  The one who took pity, so go and do likewise.
